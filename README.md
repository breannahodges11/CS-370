•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project we were given code for the following sections:  Environment, Experience for Replay, Build Model, and Play Game as well as both py files.  We had to create code for the Q-training algorithm.

•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: 

o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists use various algorithms as well as coding and programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.  This is important to advance the technological world as well as solve many problems people and businesses have.

o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I always look at the problem at hand and try to decide which algorithm or coding technique would best solve this problem.  I always try to think logically and systematically to make my work make sense to anyone that may work on it after I do.

o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
There are many ethical responsibilities in the computer science world.  These include respecting and protecting personal privacy, not causing harm to others, respect confidentiality, and do not do anything with bias.
